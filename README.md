# AXON-Sales-Analysis

ðŸš— **Axon Car Sales Analytics Project** ðŸš—

I recently completed an in-depth analytics project focused on Axonâ€™s car sales data. Using tools like Power BI, I developed a comprehensive sales dashboard that provided key insights into various performance metrics:

- **Total Sales**: $9.6M
- **Total Profit**: $3.8M
- **Top Products**: Identified leading products by sales and profit, with Classic Cars accounting for the highest sales.
- **Customer Insights**: Analyzed customer data to highlight top buyers and their impact on revenue.
- **Sales Trends**: Detailed analysis of monthly, daily, and quarterly trends to identify patterns and opportunities for growth.

This project honed my skills in data visualization, trend analysis, and deriving actionable insights to support strategic decision-making. Looking forward to leveraging these skills in a professional setting!
